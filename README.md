Utilizing NodeMCU ESP8266 and Keurig
Developing IoT keurig

Rather than using the buttons, we will have the wires connected to a circuit that will relay the same button signals (brew, power, etc) to the NodeMCU. The NodeMCU itself hosts a web server for the online interaction.

Even Whitcomb is designing/developing the website. William Nguyen is working on the code for the NodeMCU. Zach Davis is working on the electrical circuiting between the NodeMCU and the keurig
